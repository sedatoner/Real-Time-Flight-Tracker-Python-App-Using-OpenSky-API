#  Real-Time Flight Tracker (Python + OpenSky API)

This is a small Python script that pulls live flight data from the OpenSky Network API and shows it in your terminal.  
It refreshes every 10 seconds and displays basic info like callsign, country, altitude, speed, and location.

Just a fun little project to mess around with real-time flight tracking.
